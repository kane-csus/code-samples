# Python

# Simplicity and Readability
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

name = "Alice"
greet(name)

# Dynamic Typing
x = 5
x = "Hello"

# Indentation Matters
if True:
    print("This is indented")

# No Explicit Data Types
num = 42
name = "John"

# Lists vs. Arrays
my_list = [1, "two", 3.0]

# Built-in High-Level Data Types
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
my_set = {1, 2, 3}

# No Explicit Memory Management
# (No equivalent example in Python for manual memory management)

# Interpreted Language
print("Hello, World!")
